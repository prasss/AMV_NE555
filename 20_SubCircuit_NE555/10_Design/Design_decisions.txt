1) Calculations for design value of Resistor R1 (Resistor across Green LED, rated 2.4V @ 20mA), we use the following formula:
R = (Vcc - Vled)/Iled
R = (9 - 2.4)/20mA
R = 380 Ohms
Chose 390 Ohms as the standard resistor value


2) Choice of capacitor C1 -> 100nF of Ceramic type - Enables noise reduction for different noise frequencies with little to no change in characteristics such as resistance and impedance at higher frequencies.


3) The Upper and bottom planes of the PCB have been grounded to provide effective shielding and immediaate access to GND for all components.

4) For the NE555 IC, a socket has been chosen that would enable swapping of the IC incase of damages.
